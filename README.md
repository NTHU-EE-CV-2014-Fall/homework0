This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and github (no credit).
At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

## Brief self-introduction [max 500 words]

我是陳嘉臨，目前就讀電機系碩一，指導教授為林嘉文老師

## Why Computer Vision? [max 500 words]

之後做的研究為影像處理的應用，會用到相關的知識

## What do you want to achieve in the course? [ max 500 words]

想要了解更多與影像處理相關的知識，讓之後的研究能順利 :)

PS. 中文 or English are both fine.
