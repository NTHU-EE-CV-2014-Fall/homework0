This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and github (no credit).
At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

## Brief self-introduction [max 500 words]

hello!
my name is Nick, and wg is my nickname.
I'm a student in professor CTHuang's lab.

## Why Computer Vision? [max 500 words]

Our lab is working on projects about CV, so taking the course would be necessary.

## What do you want to achieve in the course? [ max 500 words]

I had read a few chapters of the book in summer vacation, but there's still many things I don't really understand.
I wish I can get through the concepts in the book in the end of the semester.

PS. 中文 or English are both fine.
