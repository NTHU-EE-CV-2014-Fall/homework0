This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and github (no credit). At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

Brief self-introduction [max 500 words]

我是從中正大學電機系畢業的鈕采紋，指導教授是鐘太郎老師。

Why Computer Vision? [max 500 words]

對未來論文可能會有幫助。

What do you want to achieve in the course? [ max 500 words]

這是我第一次上全英授課，雖然目前有點吃力，但希望這學期結束後不僅是學習到專業知識，英文聽力也可以有所進步。
PS. 中文 or English are both fine.
