This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and github (no credit).
At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

## Brief self-introduction [max 500 words]
我叫郭達人，就讀資應所碩一，指導老師是許秋婷教授。

## Why Computer Vision? [max 500 words]
由於實驗室是做影像處理以及電腦視覺相關的研究，因此想多充實這方面的知識。

## What do you want to achieve in the course? [ max 500 words]
希望能學到東西，當然，也希望拿到學分。

PS. 中文 or English are both fine.
